# MLM_Variable_Selection
The purpose of this project to derive a method to identify and estimate latent variables in a two level longitudinal model.  This work is divided into three sections, with a fourth serving as a repository for output such as images, tables, and figures.

The data generation portion of the project concerns multiple different configurations of parameter estimates, standard error, sparsity, and sample size.  For now, only a balanced case is used in the simulation studies.
